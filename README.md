# CS50P Problem Sets Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the nine problem sets from Harvard's CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python course. Each problem set is designed to reinforce key concepts in Python programming, including functions, loops, conditionals, data structures, and more.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory of the problem set you're interested in. Run the Python scripts with your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevgon8/cs50p-problem-sets-solutions.git
cd cs50p-problem-sets-solutions
```
